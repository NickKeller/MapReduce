This is anything we want to tell the TA's about our project.

This project was worked on by Nick Keller and Logan Blyth. We both used our Deadline forgivness for this project.

The intermediate files were not deleted by the program, to allow for debugging. The TA's have previously stated that debug output is ok. A handy way to remove `rm *R{0..9}`

While there was considerable collaboration throughout the primary responsibilities were as follows:

* masterworker.proto - Nick and Logan
* master.h - Nick
* worker.h - Logan
* mr_tasks.h - Logan
* file_shark.h - Nick
* mapreduce_spec.h - Nick
