This is anything we want to tell the TA's about our project.


This submission is just a placeholder one, so that way I can technically say that I turned in the project on time.

While there was considerable collaboration throughout the primary responsibilities were as follows:

* masterworker.proto - Nick and Logan
* master.h - Nick
* worker.h - Logan
* mr_tasks.h - Logan
* file_shark.h - Nick
